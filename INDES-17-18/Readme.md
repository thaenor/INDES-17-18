# INDES Projects 2017/2018

INDES is the short name for the course in the masters degree from ISEP in Multimedia.
This project is an assembly of all the exercices I've been developing on the context of this course.

The goal in these projects is to practice creating, easy, fun to use interfaces.

A quick list of the projects

. Domotica - is an interface that simulates a house and IoT items that you could toggle and control with the interface.
. Casino - like a casino machine it randomly selects 3 pieces of fruit and rewards on how many starberries you get.
. RPS (Rock Paper Scissors) - pretty self explanatory.

The "deploys" folder contains the executables for these projects and should run fine in any Windows machine.
These projects were developed with Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition
